      description: "A guide to carbs, proteins, and fats for a healthy diet.",
      content: `
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Introduction to Macronutrients</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Macronutrients are the primary building blocks of our diet, providing the energy and nutrients our body needs to function effectively. They include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, each playing a unique role in maintaining overall health.</p>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">The Role of Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Carbohydrates are the body's main source of energy. They are broken down into glucose, which fuels our cells, brain, and muscles.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Complex Carbs:</strong> Found in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, these provide long-lasting energy and fiber.</li>

          <li><strong>Avoid Processed Carbs:</strong> Limit intake of sugary snacks and white bread, as they can lead to energy crashes.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">The Importance of Protein</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, producing enzymes and hormones, and supporting immune function.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Sources of Protein:</strong> Include lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, tofu, and nuts.</li>
          <li><strong>Daily Requirement:</strong> Aim for about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or more if you are active.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Understanding Fats</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Fats are a vital part of the diet, helping to absorb vitamins, protect organs, and provide long-term energy. Not all fats are created equal, so it's essential to choose wisely.</p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Found in avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil, these support heart health.</li>
          <li><strong>Omega-3 Fats:</strong> Found in fatty fish like salmon, these reduce inflammation and promote brain health.</li>
          <li><strong>Limit Saturated and Trans Fats:</strong> Found in fried foods and processed snacks, these can increase cholesterol levels.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Finding the Right Balance</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Balancing macronutrients involves understanding your body's needs based on your age, activity level, and health goals. Here are some tips to achieve a healthy balance:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal ml-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Use a Ratio:</strong> A general guideline is to aim for 50% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 30% fat in your daily diet.</li>
          <li><strong>Focus on Quality:</strong> Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods over refined and packaged options.</li>
          <li><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Adjust your intake based on how you feel and your energy levels.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Skipping Fats:</strong> Avoid low-fat diets that eliminate healthy fats, as they are essential for hormone production and cell function.</li>
          <li><strong>Overloading on Protein:</strong> Too much protein can strain your kidneys and lead to excess calorie intake.</li>
          <li><strong>Ignoring Carbs:</strong> Low-carb diets can leave you feeling fatigued and irritable.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">Balancing macronutrients is not about strict diets or counting every calorie but rather about making informed choices that nourish your body. By including a variety of whole foods in your diet and maintaining the right proportions of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, you can achieve optimal health and energy levels.</p>

          <h2 class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">What is Fiber?</h2>
          <p class="mb-6">Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body cannot digest. It passes through the digestive system largely intact and offers several health benefits. Fiber comes in two types: soluble and insoluble.</p>

          <p class="mb-6"><strong>1. Soluble Fiber:</strong> This type dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance. It helps lower cholesterol and control blood sugar levels. Sources include oats, fruits, and beans.</p>
          <p class="mb-6"><strong>2. Insoluble Fiber:</strong> This type does not dissolve in water and aids in moving material through the digestive system. It is found in whole grains, vegetables, and nuts.</p>
